#### 2. **Implement Error Handling for Invalid API Keys**

**Objective:** Ensure the application gracefully handles scenarios where the OpenWeather API key is missing or invalid.

**Steps:**
- **Backend (`app.py`):**
  - Add a check after loading the `api_key` to verify it's not `None` or empty.
  - If the `api_key` is invalid, render an error message on the `index.html` page informing the user of the configuration issue.
  
**Expected Outcome:** If the API key is missing or incorrect, the application should display a clear error message instead of crashing or failing silently.

---

#### 3. **Refactor JavaScript to Use Fetch API Instead of Form Submission**

**Objective:** Modernize the frontend by replacing the form-based location submission with the Fetch API for asynchronous requests.

**Steps:**
- **Frontend (`index.html`):**
  - Remove the JavaScript code that creates and submits the form.
  - Implement a new function that uses `fetch` to send a POST request to the `/weather` endpoint with latitude and longitude as JSON data.
  - Handle the server response to display weather data or error messages without reloading the page.
  
**Expected Outcome:** The application should retrieve and display weather information asynchronously, providing a smoother user experience.

    ```bash
    pip install pytest Flask-Testing
    ```
- **Create Test Cases (`test_app.py`):**
  - Write test functions to:
    - Test the home route (`'/'`) returns a 200 status code.
    - Test the `/weather` route with valid and invalid data.
    - Mock API responses to test different scenarios (e.g., successful data fetch, API failure).
- **Run Tests:**
  - Execute the tests using `pytest` to ensure all cases pass.
  
**Expected Outcome:** All tests should pass, confirming that routes handle requests and errors as expected.

    ```bash
    pip install Flask-Caching
    ```
- **Configure Caching in `app.py`:**
  - Initialize the cache with a suitable configuration (e.g., simple in-memory caching).
- **Cache API Responses:**
  - Decorate the weather fetching function to cache results based on latitude and longitude for a specific duration (e.g., 10 minutes).
  
**Expected Outcome:** When users request weather data for the same location within the cache duration, the app should use cached data instead of making a new API call.

---

#### 6. **Enhance Frontend Design with Bootstrap Components**

**Objective:** Improve the visual appeal and responsiveness of the application using Bootstrap components.

**Steps:**
- **Frontend (`index.html` and `weather.html`):**
  - Utilize Bootstrap classes to style forms, buttons, and layout.

#### 7. **Handle Multiple Days Forecast**

**Objective:** Extend the application's functionality to display a multi-day weather forecast.

**Steps:**
- **Backend (`app.py`):**
  - Use the forecast data provided by the OpenWeather API to extract weather information for the next few days.
  - Pass this data to the `weather.html` template.
- **Frontend (`weather.html`):**
  - Create a section to display the forecast for each day, including temperature and weather conditions.
  
**Expected Outcome:** Users should see both the current weather and a forecast for the upcoming days on the results page.

---

#### 8. **Secure `app.secret_key` Using Environment Variables**

**Objective:** Enhance the security of your application by managing the secret key via environment variables instead of hardcoding it.

**Steps:**
- **Backend (`app.py`):**
  - Remove the hardcoded `app.secret_key`.
  - Load the secret key from an environment variable using `os.getenv`.
- **Update `.env` File:**
  - Add a new entry for `SECRET_KEY` with a strong, random value.
  
**Expected Outcome:** The application uses a secure secret key stored in environment variables, reducing the risk of exposure.

#### 9. **Add User Input for Custom Location**

**Objective:** Allow users to manually enter a location (e.g., city name) instead of relying solely on geolocation.

**Steps:**
- **Frontend (`index.html`):**
  - Add an input field and submit button for users to enter a city name.
- **Backend (`app.py`):**
  - Modify the `/weather` route to accept either geolocation data or a city name.
  - Adjust the API request parameters based on the input type.
  
**Expected Outcome:** Users can choose to automatically detect their location or manually enter a city to get weather information.
